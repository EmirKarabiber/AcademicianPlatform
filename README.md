## About The Project

![Screen Shot](screenshot1.png)

Introducing AkademISTUN, a pioneering platform in academic and social communication, integrating cutting-edge technologies including ASP.NET Core MVC, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL Server, and Microsoft API framework. Conceived by Dr. Nazlı Tokatlı, it embodies an interdisciplinary approach to research.
